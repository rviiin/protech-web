ProTech-Web is a promotional website for my our project — a 3D Platformer PC Game about Usable Security, which applies Finite State Machines as an A.I. algorithm. The website serves as both an academic presentation and a showcase platform, highlighting the game’s purpose, features, and innovative approach to security concepts.
